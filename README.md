# Jay-Travel
Web Development Program - Assignment 01
JAY TOURS is a prototype built using a blend of HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and Javascript. Although it isn't a perfect copy of the original UI, I've managed to replicate most aspects, and I've attempted to make them responsive for mobile devices.
Although the functionality of the website is limited, it serves as an example of what HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and Javascript can achieve when used simultaneously.
